Dear Anna,

I hope this message finds you well. I just wanted to check in and see how you have been doing. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I genuinely hope everything is going well on your end.

If you have some time, I'd love to hear from you and catch up. Please let me know how things have been and if there's anything exciting happening in your life.

Take care and looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Jonathan
